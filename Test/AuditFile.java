/**
 This class implements the general functionality needed to write data to the file,
 such as is needed for the audit file and media report.  It has two inherited children,
 AuditFile and MediaReport.  AuditFile adds functionality for recording the electionï¿½s audit
 file through a function that writes a header, a closed-party list vote, and an open-party list vote.
 MediaReport implements a function that writes a header to the audit file.
