/**
 * This class implements the general functionality needed to write data to the file,
 * such as is needed for the audit file and media report.  It has two inherited children,
 * AuditFile and MediaReport.  AuditFile adds functionality for recording the electionâ€™s audit
 * file through a function that writes a header, a closed-party list vote, and an open-party list vote.
 * MediaReport implements a function that writes a header to the audit file.
